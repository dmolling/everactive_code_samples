# code samples
1 ) Code from a VA project where I set up a workflow and wrote functions to clean data, easily estimate dozens of different MARS models on different subsets of the data, and visualize results. 

2) A simple R shiny app for exploring beer reviews from the site beeradvocate.com. The data used dates backt to 2017 so it is somewhat dated now but feel free to download and try it out.
