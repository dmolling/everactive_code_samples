Samples of code written for a project aimed at determining at which point 
Acute patient information obtained at time of admission (laboratory
values, diagnosis ect.) becomes less predictive of mortality
than chronic information (demographics, medical history ect.) for 
ICU patients. The idea is that for extended ICU stays, the reason
a person ends up dying is often different then the reason they were
admitted. 

I fit many Acute and Chronic MARS models to determine the number of days
in an ICU stay it takes before the Chronic model better predicts 30-day
mortality than the Acute model.
